        <p>My name is Roger. I'm somewhere in my late 20s and live in the less mormon section of Utah known as Salt Lake City. I've lived in this valley
            long enough - IMO at least. This blog is where I talk about my interests and opinions. I'm an anarchist, and prefer to leave most things to chance.
            We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
