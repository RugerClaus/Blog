        <p class="blurb">My name is Roger. I'm somewhere in my late 20s and live in the less mormon section of Utah known as Salt Lake City. I've lived in this valley
            long enough - IMO at least. This blog is where I talk about my interests and opinions. I'm an anarchist, and prefer to leave most things to chance.
            We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
            <br />
            The irony of this page is of course not lost on me. The picture clearly stabs the anonymity of a real Unknown Anarchist right in the ass. This itself is a statement.
            Why reveal my face on a pro-anonymity blog? Because I can, and damn the consequences. This is just another way to determine my true friends who will stand in class solidarity.
            No. This site is a protest against having to use my anonymity. People have been killed for less, and that's precisely the point of this page.
            <br />
            So read on, dear... reader, and share if you dare.
