        <p>And that's exactly the distinction between top vs bottom politics or economics. Property rights. That's an oxymoron. That implies that there is a natural "right" to this so-called "property". It always ends up - despite refutation from proponents - that property is the means of production for making our lives easier to live. That is to say agriculture and technology as a whole.

            Exactly. The concept of "property rights" is deeply rooted in the justification of economic and social inequality. It assumes that there is a natural right to ownership of land, resources, and means of production—things that, when traced to their origins, are social constructs that benefit a particular class of people at the expense of others.
            
            When proponents of "property rights" talk about the right to own things, they're often referring to the control of productive assets: land, factories, natural resources, and technologies that generate wealth. These are the tools that enable individuals or corporations to accumulate wealth and control others' labor. The issue arises when we examine where the wealth and resources come from. Historically, property has been accumulated through exploitation—whether that’s through colonization, slavery, or the unequal distribution of land and resources. It’s not as natural as it’s often made out to be, and certainly not a right that everyone shares equally.
            
            The concept of "property" in the capitalist sense often becomes a tool for perpetuating economic inequality. When the means of production—agriculture, technology, factories, etc.—are privately owned, it becomes much easier for those in control to accumulate wealth and power while others are forced to sell their labor to survive. This creates a system where most people do not own the tools necessary to produce their own lives but are instead dependent on a system that extracts value from their labor for the benefit of those who own the means of production.
            
            The idea of property as the means of production is particularly problematic because it turns what should be shared social resources—things that enable collective life—into individual commodities that only a select few can control. The question isn't just about ownership; it's about who controls the systems that make our lives possible. In a just society, the means of production should be shared or collectively controlled to ensure that everyone has access to the resources necessary to live a fulfilling life. This is why concepts like mutual aid, communal ownership, and cooperative economies are so central to anarchism and other leftist ideologies.
            
            Ultimately, property isn’t just about owning things—it’s about power. And when a few people own the means of production, they hold the power to shape the lives of everyone else. This concentration of power is exactly what anarchism seeks to dismantle.</p>
