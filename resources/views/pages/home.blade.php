        <h2>Contribute to Snow Blitz</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my website. If you'd like to submit a pull request, please do! I always welcome contributors. </p>
        <p>You can do a pull request for Snow Blitz or this website but I am only taking help for documenting Snow Blitz for this site</p>
        <h2>MODDERS</h2>
        <p>I hate closed source bullshit, so you can do what you would like. Feel free to create your own fork of Snow Blitz</p>
        <p>If you want support on the actual game source, I'll be spinning up unknownanarchist.blog's catchall email or something.</p>
